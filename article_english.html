The Need to Conquer the Mountains
The bicycle emerged over a century ago as an efficient method of transporting people (interestingly, a century later, this quality of the bike is being revalued), but it has always had an adventurous side, a sense of freedom, of releasing adrenaline, of opening new paths... Over time, we have witnessed brave pioneers challenging the limits of physical and mental endurance, from the daring individuals who conquered the roads of France in the epic early Tour de France to the modern asphalt warriors who engage in Ultra-Endurance competitions, dizzying descents, and the spectacular (and inexplicable) Red Bull Rampage.

The First Mountain Bikes
With bicycles, we first conquered long distances, steep mountain passes, the dreaded pav√©... Conquering mountains was inevitable and only a matter of time, but it took a while. Although there is evidence that the Buffalo Soldiers division of the U.S. Navy used Off-Road bicycles in 1897 (an interesting story), it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that the precursors of mountain bikes (MTBs) were born. While there's no consensus on which was the first in history, it seems clear that it originated around the Tamalpaiss mountains and the Larkspur Canyon Gang. However, we mark the milestone of the birth of the mountain bike in 1979 with the collaboration of Gary Fisher (and Charlie Kelly) with Tom Ritchey. These two names are essential in the history of bicycles: Fisher for his visionary approach (he was the first to propose 29" as the most suitable size for MTBs), and Ritchey for revolutionizing frame design. Together, they created the first commercial off-road bicycle in the Mountain Bikes company. The name itself, Mountain Bikes, makes it clear why we chose this moment as the beginning of mountain biking. Years later, Specialized would create the first mass-produced MTB, the globally famous Stumpjumper, which remains in their catalog.

Growth in the U.S., NORBA Series, and the Early Heroes
From this growing popularity, NORBA emerged, an association dedicated to supporting Mountain Biking throughout the United States. Although it is still active, it is now integrated into USA Cycling. NORBA played a crucial role in promoting MTB as a discipline by organizing a series of races across the United States. These events featured prominent MTB personalities, mostly Americans, as the discipline originated in the country. However, among these figures, Thomas Frischknecht stood out. Having traveled from Switzerland to California with the firm intention of beating Americans, he became a notable exception (not only did he win, but he became a legend). Legendary figures like Ned Overend and John Tomac participated in the men's category, while the women's category featured Juliana Furtado and Sarah Ballantyne. Although obtaining detailed information about the early days of MTB is challenging, NORBA's influence was undeniable in solidifying the sport.

World Championships, the Unofficial Ones
From this breeding ground, it seemed logical for more professionalized championships to appear, and that's when the first World Championships were held in 1990, right? Well, no. Although there is a lot of information about the 1990 World Championships, and it is often said they were the first, it's not true. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, there were three World Championships, but they were not sanctioned under the UCI (basically because it didn't exist yet). These world championships took place in Europe and the U.S., which is surprising since the MTB movement had flourished in the U.S. and Canada. The first ones were held in France in Villard-De-Lans. As for the winners, there were no surprises; the same people who dominated the NORBA Series also dominated the World Championships. Ned Overend, John Tomac, Mike Kloser, Mary Lee Atkins, and Sara Ballantyne emerged victorious, although Tim Gould and Silvia Furst were already among the top positions.

And the UCI is Created...
Finally, in 1990, sponsored by the UCI, the "first" World Championship was held in Durango (not the best Durango, the one where Sepp Kuss was born). This marked the beginning of a new era for MTB, the era that would introduce us to Frischnecht, Overend, Tomac, Evans, Ballantyne, Furtado, Sydor, Fullana, Dahle, Absalon, Schurter, Neff, Prevot... It's worth nothing that we are only talking about XC; we'll discuss DH from that era another time, as it also debuted in this World Championship. This first championship witnessed exciting showdowns, such as the men's race, where Ned Overend (NORBA Series dominator and winner of the first world championship) defeated two Europeans, Thomas Frieschnecht and Tim Gould, who had achieved some success in cyclocross. In the women's category, the first world champion, like in the men's division, was a legend: Juliana Furtado, surpassing the hitherto dominant Sara Ballantyne and Rutt Matthes. XCO at that time was very different both technically and in its development (longer), without a clear guide on how bicycles should be, but I'll leave you with a video where you can see how it was in that world championship, with bikes with attachments, road handlebars... Unmissable!
